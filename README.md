# Cotechino Layout
After months of experimenting, Cotechino is born. Son of [Twive family layouts](https://github.com/fractalysid/Twive_Layouts).

I started this layout towards the end of the year (2022). I had no inspiration at all for a name so I temporarily named it after the cotechino, which
is an Italian dish tipycally eaten on New Year's Eve. And now, I have even less inspiration or motivation to find a fitting name, sooo...


# Firmwares

## Core

- 34 keys, 2 keys per side on thumb cluster
- outer left thumb key almost unused
- Colemak-DH as base layer
- Space on right thumb, Return on left one
- Apostrophe on bottom pinky. Very common in italian language. Swap with another common symbol or letter
- Backspace always accessible from top pinky
- Modifiers on bottom row, mirrored. From left to right: SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, GUI
- "Utility" layer on right thumb for keys like GUI, TAB, ESC, sticky modifiers, macros and more
- Symbols layer on left thumb key
- No use of SHIFT for symbols
- No use of combos (almost)
- Prefer more layers and avoid using keys in difficult positions (a few exceptions exist where I preferred keeping the standard position)
- QWERTY layer
- Gaming layer

### Details about layers and modifiers triggering
- Bottom row modifier: Positional hold-tap, "tap-preferred" with 165ms tapping term
- Utility layer: default layer-toggle timings
- Common layer: "Balanced" with only 125ms tapping term for quick access while typing text
